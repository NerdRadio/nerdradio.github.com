[Ben Giroux](http://www.twitter.com/bengiroux) and [Burman](http://www.twitter.com/scottburman1) (yes, just Burman), join us to discuss their upcoming web series, aptly named [Ben and Burman](http://benandburman.com/).  We talk a bit the process of pitching a show, Burman's odd behaviors, and Ben's youth as the son of comic store owners.  Check out the upcoming episodes on the show website and the trailer can be found on [Dailymotion](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xl1ex4_ben-and-burman-trailer_fun).
