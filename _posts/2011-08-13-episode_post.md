Joined by [Jessica Hishe](http://twitter.com/jessicahische) and [Russ Maschmeyer](http://twitter.com/strangenative) about [Don't Fear the Internet](http://dontfeartheinternet.com), a project to help educate the masses.

Jessica discusses another new project of hers, [Inker Linker](http://www.inkerlinker.com/), and Russ talks briefly about finishing up the [MFA in Interaction Design](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/) at the [School of Visual Arts](http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/index.jsp) in New York, and his new job at Facebook.

We nerd out a bit on new TV shows afterwards.
